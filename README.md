Products are categorized, allowing users to easily navigate through different product types.
Each product includes details such as name, category, and price.

Budget Control:
Users can set budgets, and the system notifies them if their cart total exceeds the set budget during checkout.

Observers:
Observers, such as the BudgetExceededObserver and PriceDecreasedObserver, provide real-time notifications to users based on certain conditions.

Checkout Process:
Users can proceed to checkout, where various discounts are applied based on the cart's content.
The system supports payment methods like credit cards and PayPal.
